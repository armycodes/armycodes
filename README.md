# Hello Folks!! I'm Siri Mahalaxmi 👋

**Final-year Computer Science Student & Full Stack Developer**

I am a builder at heart with a strong interest in creating practical, user-focused web applications. I believe in learning by doing—building projects from scratch to understand the end-to-end flow rather than relying solely on abstractions. My goal is to merge clean logic with human emotion in software.

### 📌 Featured Projects

#### 🎧 **Echoa - AI-Powered Visual Music Companion**
*(Status: Completed ✅)*

**Echoa** is not just a music player; it is a living canvas that breathes with your sound. It creates a cinematic, minimal listening experience by translating the unseen emotions of your playlist into a visual void. 🔗 [**Live Link**](https://echoa-v1.pages.dev/)

Unlike cluttered autoplay interfaces, Echoa emphasizes intentional UX. It integrates with **Spotify** to play your tracks while using **Gemini AI** to analyze the lyrics, beat, and mood of the song in real-time, syncing the background atmosphere to match the soul of the track.

* **Core Philosophy:** "Don't just hear the music. Feel it."
* **Key Features:**
    * **Spotify Integration:** Seamless OAuth authentication and playback control.
    * **AI Mood Analysis:** Uses Gemini AI to interpret song sentiment and dynamically adjust visuals.
    * **Atmospheric UI:** Features a "Starry Night" void aesthetic with organic, non-looping animations.
    * **Tech Stack:** React (Vite), Node.js, Express, Spotify Web API, Gemini AI, Framer Motion.

### 📊 DataPulse: Real-Time Data & Schema Monitoring
> **Timeline:** July 2025 to Present
> **Status:** Production-deployed, actively developed

DataPulse is a system designed to track how data changes over time, with a focus on schema drift, structural changes, and unexpected shifts in recurring datasets. It is built around the assumption that data formats evolve silently and that integrations can break without obvious failures. Instead of treating data as static, DataPulse treats change itself as a first-class concern.

**What the system handles:**
* Monitoring recurring CSV uploads (daily / monthly)
* Read-only connections to external relational databases
* Detection of schema and structural changes over time
* Ingestion from public and authenticated APIs
* Non-blocking processing for long-running data checks
* Email notifications when changes or anomalies are detected

#### 🤝 Credits
* **Subhash Yaganti** — Project creator and system architect; backend systems, security design, data modeling, background execution, and deployment.
* **Siri Mahalaxmi Vemula** — Backend development, frontend functionality, UI/UX contributions and DataPulse AI help bot for chat-based Q&A (Gemini model integration).

### ⚖️ Justice Genie – AI-Powered Legal Assistant
> **Timeline:** Mar 2024 to Oct 2024
> **Status:** Live - Maintenance

Justice Genie is an assistive legal information tool focused on Indian law awareness. It helps users understand legal concepts and possible directions based on scenario-based inputs, without acting as a predictive or decision-making system. The project was built to explore real-world API design, data handling, and AI-assisted explanations in a sensitive domain where correctness and clarity matter.

#### 🤝 Credits
* **Siri Mahalaxmi Vemula** — Project creator and system architect; primary NLP pipeline design, backend implementation and Gemini integration.
* **Subhash Yaganti** — NLP pipeline support, frontend–backend integration, additional features (quiz, account management), and UI/UX contributions.
