# Hello Folks!! I'm Siri Mahalaxmi 👋

**Final-year Computer Science Student & Full Stack Developer**

I am a builder at heart with a strong interest in creating practical, user-focused web applications. I believe in learning by doing—building projects from scratch to understand the end-to-end flow rather than relying solely on abstractions. My goal is to merge clean logic with human emotion in software.
