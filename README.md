# Hello Folks!! I'm Siri Mahalaxmi 👋  

Final-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in building practical, user-focused web applications.  
I enjoy learning by building projects from scratch and understanding how things work end-to-end rather than relying only on abstractions.

## 📌 Projects

## 🎧 Echoa (Currently working on this)

**Echoa** is a design-first music web application focused on creating a cinematic and minimal listening experience. Inspired by vinyl culture, Echoa emphasizes smooth motion, clean typography, and intentional UX rather than cluttered autoplay interfaces.

The project integrates **Spotify authentication** to personalize the experience and is being built step-by-step using production-grade frontend and backend practices.

### Tech Stack
- React (Vite)
- Modern CSS animations
- Spotify OAuth (in progress)
- Node.js & Express (planned)
- Mostly MERN STACK

🚧 Currently building authentication flow and home experience.


🔹 **Web Workspace for Writers**  
A full-stack web application designed to help writers manage:
- Work-in-progress (WIP)
- Character building & inspiration
- Drafts and reference links
- To-do lists and important documents  

> Built to understand real-world frontend–backend flow, state management, and deployment.
